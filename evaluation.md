# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Does Not Meet Expecations**. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't see a README or planning folder in your project repo. A project like yours, which makes use of multiple technologies, definitely requires some sort of documentation that talks about what the application is all about and how a user can go about setting this up locally (especially since it makes use of Figaro - people need to know what keys they need!). If you haven't made one yet, happy to look at one when you get the chance to.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Wow! Impressed not only with how you applied Unit 2 material to this project but also how you incorporated bonus material (e.g., GitHub API, AWS).

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Good looking code! Only thing I'd suggest here is to think about how you can make your longer views (e.g., `/commits/show.html.erb`) more readable. Creating a partial or two here could be helpful. Also make sure to take a look at my inline code comments via the link below!

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations**. GitHub could learn a thing or two from your application. Great job making something unique and useful out of the project prompt. While additional models aren't necessary to implement the functionality you have now, however, I encourage you think about additional features that would require a more complex schema. That aside, great job. Excited to see what you come up with for the next project!
